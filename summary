1)points to be noticed before choosing password:
=> Use at least 12–16 characters.
=> Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.
=> Avoid using personal information or real words.
=> Don’t reuse passwords across sites.

2) summary:
      Password complexity plays a critical role in protecting accounts from attacks. A longer password with a mix of characters increases the number of possible combinations, making brute-force attacks computationally expensive and time-consuming. Passwords with predictable patterns or dictionary words are easily cracked using automated tools. Therefore, complex, unique passwords significantly enhance account security.
