This project explores what makes a password strong and how to evaluate password security using various tools. A strong password is critical for protecting personal and sensitive information from unauthorized access. Through this activity, we learned that strong passwords should be long (ideally 12 characters or more), include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, and avoid using easily guessable patterns like names, dictionary words, or repeated sequences. We tested a variety of passwords using online password strength checkers such as Kaspersky Password Checker, PasswordMonster, and Have I Been Pwned. These tools provided insights into the strength and potential vulnerabilities of each password. Our findings showed that simple or common passwords (e.g., "123456" or "qwerty123") were rated very weak, while random, complex combinations (e.g., "xK9!@jLz#2Wv") were considered very strong. The project highlights the importance of using unique, complex passwords for every account and recommends using a password manager and enabling multi-factor authentication to further enhance account security.
